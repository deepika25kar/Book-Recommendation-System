# Book Recommendation System

Hello, I am a sophomore student pursuing B.Tech. in Information Technology from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, New Delhi.

This is a project depicting a book recommendation system using popularity based and collaborative filtering based recommendation system. These also use sorting algorithms within themselves.

Recommendation system is a piece of code which is intelligent enough to understand the preferences of the user according to which it suggests new content. Its target is to increase profit.
It is of four types:
1.  a
2.  b
3.  c

The following packages are needed to be installed for successful execution of code:
* numpy
* panda
* flask
