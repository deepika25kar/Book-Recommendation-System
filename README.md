# Book Recommendation System

Hello, I am a pre-final year student pursuing B.Tech. in Information Technology from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, New Delhi.

This is a project depicting a book recommendation system using popularity based and collaborative filtering based recommendation system. These also use sorting algorithms within themselves.  <br/><br/>

## Introduction<br/>
Recommendation system is a piece of code which is intelligent enough to understand the preferences of the user according to which it suggests new content. Its target is to increase profit.
It is of four types:
1.  Popularity based recommender system - The most popular items of the platform are recommended (Example - "Trending" section on YouTube)
2.  Content based recommender system - Recommendation is done on the basis of similarity of items.
3.  Collaborative Filtering based recommender system - Recommendation is done on the basis of what the user likes (ratings it has given to various items).
4.  Hybrid recommender system - An approach that is hybrid of two or more types of the algorithms above.  <br/><br/>

## Installation/Get Started <br/>
The following packages are needed to be installed for successful execution of code:
* numpy
* panda
* flask <br/><br/>


## Features of the application <br/>
* Home page with display of results of popularity based recommender system
* Search button using which user can search book names
* Search results give recommendation results using collaborative filtering based recommender system <br/><br/>


## Built with
* Flask (for creating website)
* Numpy and Pandas (for performing EDA on the dataset and developing the ML models)
* sklearn also imported to use cosine_similarity for collaborative filtering based recommendation system <br/><br/><br/><br/>
