# Book-Recommendation-System

Hello, I am a sophomore student pursuing B.Tech. in Information Technology from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, New Delhi.

This is a project that I have created as a mentee in the Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program 2022.

It is a project depicting book recommendation system using popularity based and collaborative filtering based recommendation system. These also use sorting algorithms within themselves.

The following packages are needed to be installed for execution of code:
\n numpy
panda
flask
